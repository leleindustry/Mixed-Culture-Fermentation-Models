This readme describes the use of two mixed culture fermentation metabolic models: a unicellular model and a mixed community model

## Prerequisites
* [Python 3.5 or later] (https://www.python.org/downloads/) -  Both metabolis models are written with python. Matlab versions can be created using CobraPy. 
 
* [CobraPy] (https://cobrapy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) - Python package for metbaolic modeling using the COBRA framework.

## Recommended Software
* [PyCharm] (https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) - Integrated development environment used for constructing the models.

## Model Descriptions

**iFerment156**
iFerment156 is a unicellular metabolic model with 156 reactions.

**iFermGuilds548**
iFermGuids548 is a community metbaolic model with 548 reactions distributed amongst six guilds.

## Getting started

**Feeding the model**

**Turning reactions on and off**

**Constraining products**

**Constraining "growth rates"**

**Considering transport energetics**
